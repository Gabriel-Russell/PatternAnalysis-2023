# **Implementing the VQVAE model on the OASIS-1 brain dataset**

## Background on VQVAE

### What is it?
VQ-VAE stands for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder. It is one type of variational autoencoder amongst others and uses vector quantisation to obtain discrete latent representation (Oord, A et al., 2018).

### How it works?


### Why it is effective?

## Background on the OASIS-1 brain dataset
The OASIS-1 dataset consists of Cross-sectional MRI Data in young, middle aged, nondemented and demented older adults. This dataset arose from 416 subjects aged from 18 - 96 with over 434 MR sessions.
